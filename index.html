    <h2>life</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Albert Einstein</b>; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a
      German-born<br />
      theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest<br />
      physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the
      theory<br />
      of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
      development<br />
      of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics
      are<br />
      together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence
      formula<br />
      <span class="eq">E = mc<sup>2</sup></span> <br />
      which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the<br />
      world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence
      on<br />
      the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics<br />
      "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
      discovery<br />
      of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the
      development<br />
      of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality
      resulted<br />
      in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".

      In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle
      <br />
      year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined
      the<br />
      theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion,
      introduced<br />
      special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein<br />
      thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be
      reconciled<br />
      with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his<br />
      special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to
      gravitational<br />
      fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing<br />
      his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of<br />
      relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal<br />
      with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to<br />
      his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He
      also<br />
      investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of<br />
      radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.<br />
